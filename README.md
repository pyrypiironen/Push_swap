## Description

This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.


You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.
Your goal is to write two programs in C:

- The first, named `checker` which takes integer arguments and reads instructions on the standard output. Once read, it executes them and displays `OK` if integers are sorted. Otherwise, it will display `KO`.
- The second one is called `push_swap` which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program using instruction language that sorts integer arguments received.

Within your mandatory part you are allowed to the following functions:
- `write`
- `read`
- `malloc`
- `free`
- `exit`
 
### Game rules
- The game is composed of two stacks named `a` and `b`.
- To start with:
  - `Stack a` contains a random number of either positive or negative numbers without any duplicates.
  - `Stack b` is empty.
- The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into `stack a`.
- To do this you have the following operations at your disposal:

| Operations | Description |
| :---:      | :---        |
| sa | `swap a` - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. |
| sb | `swap b` - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. |
| ss | `sa` and `sb` at the same time. |
| pa | `push a` - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do
nothing if `b` is empty. |
| pb | `push b` - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. |
| ra | `rotate a` - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. |
| rb | `rotate b` - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. |
| rr | `ra` and `rb` at the same time. |
| rra |
