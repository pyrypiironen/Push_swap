## Description

This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.

![Screen-Recording-2023-01-02-at-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93189576/210230993-e4c7f72a-2912-4ef9-8e69-cd16125e187d.gif)

You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.
Your goal is to write two programs in C:

- The first, named `checker` which takes integer arguments and reads instructions on the standard output. Once read, it executes them and displays `OK` if integers are sorted. Otherwise, it will display `KO`.
- The second one is called `push_swap` which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program using instruction language that sorts integer arguments received.

Within your mandatory part you are allowed to the following functions:
- `write`
- `read`
- `malloc`
- `free`
- `exit`
 
### Game rules
- The game is composed of two stacks named `a` and `b`.
- To start with:
  - `Stack a` contains a random number of either positive or negative numbers without any duplicates.
  - `Stack b` is empty.
- The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into `stack a`.
- To do this you have the following operations at your disposal:

| Operations | Description |
| :---:      | :---        |
| sa | `swap a` swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. (Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.) |
| sb | `swap b` swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. (Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.) |
| ss | `sa` and `sb` at the same time. |
| pa | `push a` take the first element at the top of `b` and put it at the top of `a`. (Do nothing if `b` is empty.) |
| pb | `push b` take the first element at the top of `a` and put it at the top of `b`. (Do nothing if `a` is empty.) |
| ra | `rotate a` shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one. |
| rb | `rotate b` shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one. |
| rr | `ra` and `rb` at the same time. |
| rra | `reverse rotate a` shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one. |
| rrb | `reverse rotate b` shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one. |
| rrr | `rra` and `rrb` at the same time. |

## Usage
Run `make` to compile both programs.
### checker
`./checker  <list of integers>`
- `checker` will get as an argument the `stack a` formatted as a list of integers. The first argument should be at the top of the stack.
  - If no argument is given `checker` stops and displays nothing.
- After that `checker` will then wait and read instructions on the standard input, each instruction will be followed by `\n`.
- Once all the instructions have been read, checker will execute them on the stack received as an argument.
  - Execute by `CTRL + D`
- If after executing those instructions, `stack a` is actually sorted and `b` is empty, the output is `OK`.
  - Otherwise the output is `KO`.
- In case of error, the output is simply `Error`.
- Note that the input must be clean.
  - Integers
  - No duplicates
  - Separated with spaces

### push_swap
`./push_swap <list of integers>`
- `push_swap` will get as an argument the `stack a` formatted as a list of integers. The first argument should be at the top of the stack.
- The program displays the smallest list of instructions possible to sort the `stack a`, the smallest number being at the top.
  - Instructions are separated by a `\n`.
- Note that the input must be clean or the program displays just `Error`.
  
 **ADD IMAGE HERE**
 
 - To get count of instructions `push_swap` needs to sort the stack use command `wc -1` via pipe.
 
 `ARG="<list of integers>"; ./push_swap $ARG | wc -1`
 
 **ADD IMAGE HERE**
 
### push_swap with checker
`ARG="<list of integers>"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG`
- Programs can be used together. In this case `push_swap` sort the stack and `checker` read the standart input to displays `OK` or `KO` depending on whether the stack is in right order or not.
  - In other words `checker` checks if `push_swap` works correctly.

 ## The Algorithm

The algorithm of push_swap was the key part of the project and a great way to challenge myself to optimize it as well as I can.

My basic idea into an algorithm is to push the numbers once to stack b in the order that makes it possible to push them back to stack a straight to right order with the least rotation on stack b while finding the next number to push back. To do that I split the numbers on segments and push them to stack b in the order that I can always find the biggest or the smallest number without going too deep on the stack. The most important thing in terms of efficiency is that the algorithm always has two options of which number it will rotate to the top of stack b and push back to stack a. If the stack b isnâ€™t sorted well for this purpose it causes extra rotation for every step and ruins the efficiency.

### Pre optimization: sequence numbers

Before starting to run the algorithm I give a sequence number to every number (integer). Thanks to this the algorithm can use, for example, sequence numbers 1 to 500 except 500 random integer values. The real trick is that the sequence numbering starts at the middle of numbers (and loop from biggest to smallest) which saves on average over 200 moves with a stack of 500 numbers. That is because the algorithm pushes numbers back to stack a starting with the biggest and the smallest numbers which leaves the smallest number in the middle of the stack a after the last number has pushed back. Now when the smallest sequence  number is the middle of the stack a it means that the smallest number is top of the stack.

**ADD IMAGES TO COMPARE**

In the name of simplicity numbers refer to the sequence numbers in the following text.

###  Segments

First, I divide the numbers into either 4, 16 or 32 segments depending on the amount of numbers to make the algorithm as efficient as possible. Sets of less than 40 numbers are divided into 4 segments, sets of 40-350 numbers are divided into 16 segments and larger sets of numbers are divided into 32 segments.

When the numbers are divided into segments, I start to rotate stack a and move the numbers belonging to the middle four segments to stack b. When these have all been moved, I expand the search area by two segments in both directions and repeat this until all the numbers (except three smallest) have been moved to stack b.

For each moved number, I check whether the number belongs to the largest or the smallest segment to be moved, in which case the number is left at the top of the stack and otherwise moved to the bottom of the stack.  At this point I also rotate the stack a on the same move if necessary. After that the numbers are in the order that when moving numbers back to stack a I can always find the biggest or the smallest number from the top or from the bottom of stack b without going too deep on it.

```c
void	push_segments(t_data *d, t_stack **a, t_stack **b)
{
	*a = d->head_a;
	d->min = (d->segments + 1) / 2 - 2;
	d->max = (d->segments + 1) / 2 + 1;
	while (d->min >= 0 && d->head_a != NULL)
	{
		while (still_left(d) == 1)
		{
			if ((*a)->segment >= d->min && (*a)->segment <= d->max \
				&& (*a)->sequence > 3)
			{
				push_b(d, a, b);
				// Left segments min and max top of the stack b, but rotate
				// another ones to bottom. Also rotate stack a on same move
				// if necessary.
				if ((*b)->segment == d->min + 1 || (*b)->segment == d->max - 1)
				{
					if ((*a)->segment < d->min || (*a)->segment > d->max)
						rotate_both(d, a, b);
					else
						rotate_b(d, a, b);
				}
			}
			else
				rotate_a(d, a, b);
		}
		d->min -= 2;
		d->max += 2;
	}
}
```

### Push back
	
I start by finding out whether the distance to the smallest or the largest number is longer from the top of the stack b. After that, I find the number that has a shorter distance, rotate it top of the stack b and push to the stack a. If the number is the smallest possible, I rotate it to the bottom of stack a, so that the numbers are immediately placed in ascending order in stack a. After pushed every number back to stack a, the smallest number would remain in the middle of the stack if the real values of the numbers would be used, but since I use sequence numbers as described above, I can avoid this.

```c
void	push_back(t_data *d, t_stack **a, t_stack **b)
{
	d->max = d->total;
	d->min = 4;
	while (d->min <= d->max)
	{
		if (distance_to_big(d, b) <= distance_to_small(d, b))
			seek_big(d, a, b);
		else
			seek_small(d, a, b);
	}
}
```
</details>
	
I also use an optimization that checks whether when searching for the smallest number, the second smallest number is found, or when searching for the largest number, the second largest number is found. If this is the case, I move this number to stack a before the number to be searched and when the number to be searched has also been found and moved, I change the places of the numbers in stack a by rotating once.

## Visualizer
 
I created a simple visualizer to illustrate how the program works. The Visualizer is coded using C and mainly the ft_printf function which is my own implementation of the library function printf.
	
Visualizer works with `-v` flag. Another flags can be used only with the `-v` flag.
	
Another flags:
- `-s` shows segment on parentheses after number.
- `-seq` shows the sequence number on every number instead of its real value.
- `-p` paused visualizer for one second after every move.

## Rating
My push_swap is very successful and fast. It can solve a set of 500 random integers about 4450 to 4600 moves when the limit to full points on the scoring system is 5500 and a set of 100 random integers about 550 to 570 moves when the limit of full points on the scoring system is 700. I havenâ€™t seen a faster one, but let me know if you have one!
